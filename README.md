## _Huat Did I Win?_

Listening to the radio, checking the newspaper and online sources are the few avenues available for punters in Singapore to check the Singapore Pools lottery results every week. However, upon buying many tickets, it is often easy to miss a number or two in our haste. Even with proper concentration, the tedium of entering the numbers one-by-one can quickly be tiresome.

Using GCP-provided Optical Character Recognition models, "_Huat_ Did I Win", a pun using "_Huat_" which in Hokkien meaning "prosper", provides gamblers and easy way to simply scan their physical tickets for a quick litmus test for a windfall!

## Demo

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on endpoints served from `pages/api`.

In order to access the GCP Vision API, follow the [setup guide from GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup). Ticket recognition will not work without a service account for the server.

* Credits to my partner-in-crime [Rachel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelanya/) for the incredible name of the web app.
* Credits to my family for trying their luck at the recent $8 million prize pot and painstakingly using the Singapore pools website, which was **so infuriating** to use that this idea was spawned.
